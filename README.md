# Motivation

I am a graduate student in CompSci living in Boston, I'm exploring topics, one of them being bioinformatics.

# Rosalind Problem Solutions

![Rosalind Logo](https://rosalind.info/static/img/logo.png)

This repository contains Python solutions to various problems from [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/), a platform for learning bioinformatics through problem-solving. Each problem on Rosalind introduces a specific bioinformatics concept or algorithm, and the solutions provided here are meant to demonstrate how to tackle these problems using Python programming.

## About Rosalind

Rosalind is a platform that offers a collection of bioinformatics problems ranging from basic concepts to more complex algorithms. These problems are designed to help users learn bioinformatics by applying programming skills to real biological challenges.

## Repository Structure

Each problem on Rosalind corresponds to a specific directory in this repository. The directory names follow the same format as the problem titles on Rosalind. Inside each directory, you'll find:

- A Python solution file named after the problem title, e.g., `counting_nucleotides.py`.
- Additional resources, explanations, or notes related to the problem (if applicable).

Feel free to explore the solutions, understand the code, and modify them for your own learning purposes.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AbhinavMir/bioinformatics
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific problem's directory that you're interested in.
   ```
   cd Problem_Title
   ```

3. Open the corresponding Python solution file using a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).

4. Read the code comments and study the solution's logic and implementation.

5. Modify the solutions, experiment with different approaches, or optimize the code as you see fit.

## Disclaimer

The solutions provided here are intended for educational and learning purposes. They may not be the most optimized or efficient solutions, but they should give you a starting point for solving similar problems on the Rosalind platform.
